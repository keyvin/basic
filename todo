After stripping all spaces, parsing is not beginning at proper point...

I also just realized I would be removing all spaces within a string.



I need to define the variable type enum.

Where should the string data type be allocated. I think I will use the function.

I need to implement an undefined behavior that throws an error.

refactor varlist typedefed to var into varlist type....

*important*****
I need to start on the parser and eval types tomorrow.
